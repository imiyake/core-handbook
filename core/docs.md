There are many ways in which it is possible to contribute to the Documentation team.

Most of the Documentation Team work ends up in one of these two sites:

*   [developer.wordpress.org](https://developer.wordpress.org/) (aka *DevHub*) – This is where all the documentation aimed to developers are, such as Code reference, Plugins and Themes development handbooks and more.
*   [wordpress.org/support](https://wordpress.org/support) (aka *HelpHub*) – This is where all the documentation aimed to the end-user are, such as Installation instructions, Admin panel reference and more.

If you want to contribute to WordPress Docs, check out the [Documentation Team’s handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/).
